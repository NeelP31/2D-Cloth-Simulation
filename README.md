# 2D Cloth Simulation
Verlet Softbody and Cloth Simulation built using Javascript and HTML. 

Overview
-------
Ever wanted to simulate realistic cloth physics in a 2D environment? This 2D Cloth Simulation leverages Verlet integration to create softbody and fabric-like motion with stability and smooth interactions. Whether you're experimenting with physics-based animations or integrating cloth mechanics into a game, this simulation provides a lightweight and effective solution.

Features
--------
1. Verlet Integration – Provides smooth and stable motion without explicit velocity calculations.
2. Cloth & Softbody Physics – Simulates fabric-like behavior with constraints and elasticity.
3. Realistic Constraints – Ensures proper structural integrity and movement.
4. Performance Optimized: Designed to be fast and lightweight for real-time applications.
